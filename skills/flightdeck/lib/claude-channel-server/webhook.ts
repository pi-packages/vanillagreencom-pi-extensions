#!/usr/bin/env bun
// Vendored MCP webhook server for flightdeck Phase 2 (claude code Channels).
// Spawned by claude itself as an MCP stdio subprocess via the per-pane
// .mcp.json. Listens on CC_CHANNEL_PORT (HTTP, 127.0.0.1) and forwards
// POST bodies into claude's context as a `<channel source="webhook"
// session="..." ...>` tag.
//
// One bun process per claude pane → one port per pane. Port is allocated
// host-globally in the 8780-8879 range under flock. Session label is the
// flightdeck issue id, baked into the tag's session= attribute so master
// can scope events.
//
// Localhost-only and ungated — assumes single-user dev workstation.
