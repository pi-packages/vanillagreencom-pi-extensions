# Workflow: `watch` — Master Loop

Master mode entry point. Polls every spawned issue pane, classifies their prompts, routes to handlers, plans merges, and drives every tracked issue to a terminal state. Wakes are driven by `flightdeck-daemon` (an external bash poller spawned at session start) — the harness scheduler is no longer load-bearing.

**Inputs**: `[ISSUE_IDS]` — the issue list spawned by flightdeck's `start.md` (auto-passed at handoff). Auto-detect `$TMUX_SESSION` via `tmux display-message -p '#S'` and stable `$SESSION_ID` via `tmux display-message -p '#{session_id}'`.

**Pre-conditions**:
- `$TMUX` set (the SKILL.md mode-switch already gates this — unreachable otherwise).
- flightdeck's `start.md` § 4 just returned from `open-terminal` for one or more issues, OR a state file already exists for compaction-recovery re-entry.
- `[ISSUE_IDS]` non-empty OR an existing `tmp/flightdeck-state-<SESSION>.json` file is present.
- `github` and `linear` skills loaded.

**Post-condition**: master state `terminated: true`, summary file written, control returned to flightdeck's dashboard loop.

## § 1: Initialize Master State

1. Resolve session: `SESSION=$(tmux display-message -p '#S')`, `SESSION_ID=$(tmux display-message -p '#{session_id}')`.
2. Init / resume master state:
   ```
   .agents/skills/flightdeck/scripts/flightdeck-state init
   ```
   Idempotent — preserves an existing state file if one exists (compaction-recovery path).
3. Reconcile registry against live tmux windows (drops stale entries from prior sessions whose windows are gone):
   ```
   .agents/skills/flightdeck/scripts/pane-registry reconcile
   ```
4. For each `ISSUE_ID` in the spawn batch, build / refresh registry entry:
   - Look up the spawned window by name (`open-terminal` names windows after the issue ID, lowercased).
   - Determine harness from the agent process running in pane 0 (`tmux list-panes -t <session>:<window> -F '#{pane_index} #{pane_current_command}'`).
   - Determine worktree path (passed by `start.md`; cross-check `git worktree list`).
   - Pin the orchestrator-pane index by fingerprinting (see `patterns/tmux-monitoring.md` § Pane-0 rule). If only one pane, index 0.
   - Resolve the stable `%pane_id` for the orchestrator pane via `tmux display-message -p -t <session>:<window>.<pane> '#{pane_id}'`.
   - Register:
     ```
     .agents/skills/flightdeck/scripts/pane-registry init <ISSUE_ID> \
       --window <window-name> --harness <h> --worktree <path> --pane-index <N>
     ```
5. **Spawn or attach the daemon**. If no daemon is running for this session, spawn one. Pass the master pane and the comma-separated list of inner orchestrator panes:
   ```
   MASTER_PANE="$SESSION:1.<base-pane-index>"  # the pane this watch.md runs in
   INNER_PANES="$(.agents/skills/flightdeck/scripts/pane-registry list --format inner-panes)"
   .agents/skills/flightdeck/scripts/flightdeck-daemon start \
     --session "$SESSION" \
     --master "$MASTER_PANE" \
     --inner "$INNER_PANES"
   ```
   `start` self-daemonizes via `setsid + nohup`: the call blocks until the child writes its PID file, then returns. Do NOT add `&` or harness-specific backgrounding — the daemon survives the calling shell's lifecycle on its own. The daemon refuses via flock if already running for this session, so the call is idempotent and safe on every `watch` re-entry.

   For codex / opencode / pi masters, prefer the tmux-window spawn mode (set `FD_SPAWN_MODE=tmux-window` env or pass `--in-tmux-window`). The daemon runs inside a dedicated tmux window in the same session; lifetime ties to the tmux session (which is the architectural boundary of a flightdeck session anyway), and the window is visually inspectable. Detach mode is the default for Claude Code where `run_in_background` reparenting is reliable.
6. **Atomic master-busy lock** — write `tmp/fd-master-<SESSION_KEY>.busy` via temp+mv:
   ```
   .agents/skills/flightdeck/scripts/flightdeck-state master-busy lock
   ```
   This signals the daemon that master is mid-turn and prevents wake delivery during processing.
7. **Drain pending events** for hint-level visibility into which panes are ready:
   ```
   PENDING=$(.agents/skills/flightdeck/scripts/flightdeck-daemon events --session "$SESSION_ID")
   ```
   `PENDING` is JSONL with `{ts, pane_id, hash, tag, reason, stable_age_sec}` per ready pane. Structured question events (`oc-question`, `pi-question`) also include `details: {event_type, request_id, question, harness}`. Use these as routing hints; § 2 polls every tracked pane regardless except when a structured question event already supplies the prompt payload.
8. If resuming, recompute the conflict graph against the live PR set in case PRs moved during compaction:
   ```
   .agents/skills/flightdeck/scripts/pr-conflict-graph <PR1> <PR2> ...
   ```
   Persist via `flightdeck-state set conflict_graph <json>`.

---

## § 2: Poll

For each tracked issue currently in a non-terminal state (`waiting | prompting | submitting | merge-ready`):

0. **Structured-question event check** — if `PENDING` contains an event for this issue's pane with `tag == "oc-question"` or `tag == "pi-question"`, set state to `prompting`, substate to that tag, and carry `details.request_id` + `details.question` into `handle-prompt.md`. Do not try to rediscover this by `capture-pane`; the inline/modal question may not appear in plain assistant text.

0.5. **Pane-hijack check** — only if `orchestration_started` is `false` for this issue:
   - If the orchestration workflow-state file exists at `tmp/workflow-state-<ISSUE>.json` (or wherever `ORCH_STATE_DIR` resolves to), set `orchestration_started: true` via `pane-registry set <ISSUE> orchestration_started true` and proceed to step 1.
   - Otherwise check `(now - spawned_at)`. If elapsed exceeds `FLIGHTDECK_HIJACK_GRACE_SECS` (default 90), the pane was either hijacked for unrelated work or orchestration silently failed to start. Escalate: `paused_for_user = {issue_id, reason: "orchestration-never-started", prompt_text: "<ISSUE> spawned <elapsed>s ago; no workflow-state file. Pane may have been hijacked or orchestration failed to start."}`. Skip the rest of § 2 for this issue.
1. Run `pane-poll`. Pass `--harness <h>`, `--worktree <path>`, and `--pr <N>` from the registry so harness-specific capture quirks (e.g., opencode viewport scroll) are handled and the orphan cross-check can synthesize `terminal-state-reached` when the buffer's own sentinels miss but the worktree is gone + PR merged:
   ```
   .agents/skills/flightdeck/scripts/pane-poll <session>:<window> <pinned-pane-index> \
     --harness <h> \
     --worktree <worktree-path-from-registry> \
     --pr <pr-number-from-registry>
   ```
2. Parse JSON. If `dead: true` → `pane-registry set-state <ISSUE> dead` and continue.

   **Pane-fingerprint drift recovery**: if `fingerprint_match: false` AND `pane_index_suggest` is non-null, the orchestrator pane moved (sub-agent restart, layout reflow, harness restart). Update the registry to the suggested index and log a warning:
   ```
   .agents/skills/flightdeck/scripts/pane-registry set <ISSUE> pane_target "\"<session>:<window>.<suggest>\""
   ```
   Re-poll on the new index this cycle. If `fingerprint_match: false` AND `pane_index_suggest` is null, no sibling matched the orchestrator sentinel either — the pane may be genuinely idle/blank or the agent crashed; treat the read as authoritative for this cycle and let the state machine route normally (often `idle` → no-op).
3. Otherwise update state machine based on `tag`:

   | tag | new state | notes |
   |-----|-----------|-------|
   | `idle` | unchanged | nothing to do |
   | `rendering` | unchanged | re-poll next cycle |
   | `terminal-state-reached` | (handled below) | route to `close-issue.md`; do not enter `prompting` |
   | `bash-permission-prompt` | `prompting` | substate = tag |
   | `cleanup-prompt` | `prompting` | substate = tag |
   | `bot-review-wait-stuck` | `prompting` | substate = tag |
   | `rebase-multi-choice` | `prompting` | substate = tag |
   | `force-push-prompt` | `prompting` | substate = tag |
   | `audit-relation-prompt` | `prompting` | substate = tag |
   | `merge-now` | `prompting` | substate = tag |
   | `merge-ready-but-unknown` | `prompting` | substate = tag; if `unknown_since` is null, set it now |
   | `force-merge-confirm` | `prompting` | substate = tag |
   | `external-fix-suggestions` | `prompting` | substate = tag |
   | `cycle-fix-suggestions` | `prompting` | substate = tag |
   | `descope-related` | `prompting` | substate = tag |
   | `multi-select-tabbed` | `prompting` | substate = tag (handler picks via `--option-multi`) |
   | `awaiting-direction` | `prompting` | substate = tag (handler synthesizes a continuation directive from registry intent) |
   | `generic-multi-choice` | `prompting` | substate = tag (handler auto-decides per § 10 of `handle-prompt.md`, escalates only on novelty) |
   | `oc-question` | `prompting` | substate = tag; handler uses structured event details, not pane text |
   | `pi-question` | `prompting` | substate = tag; handler uses structured event details, including `allowCustom` |

   **`terminal-state-reached` routing**: do not transition to `prompting`. Instead invoke `⤵ workflows/close-issue.md <ISSUE_ID>`. That workflow verifies the signal (two-signal rule), updates master state, and tears down the window. Returns here when done.

4. Hash debounce: if `capture_hash` matches `last_capture_hash` AND `bell == false`, skip routing — the prompt is the same one already handled.
5. Update `last_capture_hash` and `last_polled_at` on every poll.

## § 3: Decision Routing

**Process prompting issues SEQUENTIALLY, not in parallel.** Adapter calls (opencode HTTP-attach in Phase 1, future channels/socket/WS) are synchronous — no per-call round-trip cost — but classifier work and decision routing must stay ordered. Concurrent handler invocations across panes interleave decision logs, race the dedup state in the daemon's wake-pending tracker, and create cognitive-load-induced response errors at the master pane. Serialize for ordering, not for latency.

For each issue currently in `state == "prompting"` and not debounced in § 2, **one at a time**:

1. `⤵ workflows/handle-prompt.md <ISSUE_ID> <SUBSTATE_TAG> → § 4` — pass the captured buffer plus the classification tag. For `oc-question` / `pi-question`, pass the structured event `details` (`request_id`, `question`, `harness`) instead of treating the TUI buffer as authoritative. Handler decides the response (auto-answer, escalate, or custom/free-text with combined guidance).
2. After handler returns:
   - If a response was sent: `pane-respond` already cleared the bell and logged the decision via `pane-registry log-decision`. For tmux-fallback panes pass `--confirm-advanced` — it polls until the prompt sentinel is gone (8s timeout, exit 4 on miss) so the loop doesn't move on while the previous send is still in flight. Adapter-mode opencode is naturally synchronous (`opencode run --attach` blocks until the turn completes), so `--confirm-advanced` is a safe no-op there.
   - If escalated to user: master state's `paused_for_user` is now populated; the watch loop yields control to the user. Resumption happens when the user re-invokes `watch`.
3. Re-poll the same window after a confirmed-advanced response to detect the next state (the agent typically advances to its next phase within a few seconds). Only after the prompt has visibly advanced (or `--confirm-advanced` timed out and recovery is logged) move on to the next prompting issue.

**Pre-flight optimization (when ≥ 3 issues are prompting concurrently)**: capture + classify all panes in parallel during § 2 (background subshells writing to per-pane temp files; collect after a barrier). Sequencing constraint applies to § 3 response-send only — capture is read-only and parallelizable.

---

## § 4: Merge Planning

When **at least one** issue's state has reached `merge-ready` (the per-issue agent has emitted a "Merge now" prompt that handler approved, or auto-merge was triggered):

1. `⤵ workflows/merge-plan.md → § 5` — build the conflict graph from current PR file lists, smallest-scope-first ordering, execute the next safe merge.
2. After each merge, the merged issue transitions to `merged` and is removed from the active set. The graph mutates; merge-plan recomputes for the remaining queue.

---

## § 5: Bell Cleanup

`pane-respond` clears the bell on every successful send via the chained `select-window` idiom. The daemon also clears bells via the same idiom after delivering a wake. No additional cleanup needed in the loop. If bells are observed on idle (no prompt) windows during § 2, clear them defensively:

```
.agents/skills/flightdeck/scripts/pane-clear-bell <session>:<window>
```

(Stale bells from earlier prompts the user manually answered.)

---

## § 6: Termination Check

At the end of each poll cycle:

1. Count issues by state. If every tracked issue is in `merged | aborted | dead` AND every issue's `state` is not `prompting` → increment a debounce counter.
2. If the debounce counter reaches `FLIGHTDECK_DEBOUNCE_CYCLES` (default 2) consecutive cycles → `⤵ workflows/terminate.md → END`.
3. Otherwise, fall through to § 7 (Status Dashboard) → § 8 (Yield).

---

## § 7: Status Dashboard

Emit a per-cycle dashboard summarizing the current state of every tracked issue. The user (and any second-party reviewer of the master pane scrollback) reads this to understand what the master agent is doing without inspecting state files. Per SKILL.md "Format Tags Are Literal": fill placeholders, omit empty rows, add nothing else.

For each tracked issue, gather:
- **Phase** — invoke `flightdeck-state phase <ISSUE>` which reads `tmp/workflow-state-<ISSUE>.json` (orchestration's own state) and composes a phase descriptor (e.g., `cycle=2 reviewers=3 pr-review=1`). Falls back to `fd:<state>` from the flightdeck registry when no orchestration state file exists, or `unknown` if neither is present. Do NOT short-cut to `state == "rendering"` from flightdeck's view alone — that hides orchestration progress.
- **Last prompt** — most recent `decisions_log[-1].prompt_tag` from registry, plus a short prompt-text excerpt (truncated to ~50 chars). `—` if no decisions yet.
- **Answer** — most recent `decisions_log[-1].answer` (truncated to ~40 chars). `—` if none.
- **PR** — `registry.<ISSUE>.pr_number`. `—` if not yet opened.

## § 8: Yield

End-of-turn handoff to the daemon:

1. **Atomic ack** — drain any newcomer events that arrived during this turn AND clear `WAKE_PENDING` in one operation:
   ```
   FINAL=$(.agents/skills/flightdeck/scripts/flightdeck-daemon ack --session "$SESSION_ID")
   ```
   Race-safe: daemon cannot extend in-flight while master holds the session lock through this action. If `FINAL` is non-empty, process the newcomer events (re-poll the named panes, route to handlers as in § 3). Repeat until ack returns empty.

2. **Release master-busy lock** AFTER ack completes:
   ```
   .agents/skills/flightdeck/scripts/flightdeck-state master-busy unlock
   ```
   Order matters: clearing wake-pending FIRST then releasing busy means the daemon's next tick sees a clean state. Reversing the order leaves a window where daemon could create a new wake before master cleared pending.

3. **End the turn**. The daemon will type `/flightdeck watch --from-daemon<Enter>` into this pane when the next attention-ready event arrives. Do NOT use `sleep` (blocks the turn) and do NOT use `ScheduleWakeup`-equivalent (no longer needed; daemon owns wake). On Claude Code specifically, you MAY arm a defensive `ScheduleWakeup({delaySeconds: 1800})` as a "if daemon is dead, wake me anyway" safety net — but this is optional, not load-bearing.

If `paused_for_user` is set, do NOT release the busy lock or end the turn. Wait for user to re-invoke `watch` after addressing the pause.

---

## § 9: Compaction Recovery

Master state persists on every mutation. On `watch` re-entry after compaction (or an explicit user resume):

1. `flightdeck-state init` is idempotent — it loads the existing state file.
2. Re-fingerprint each registered window's pane 0 (TUIs may have re-laid-out across compaction).
3. Recompute every issue's `state` from a fresh `pane-poll`. Persisted state is a hint, not truth.
4. The `unknown_since` timer is preserved across compaction, so the force-merge clock does not reset.
5. The daemon may have continued running through compaction; § 1 step 5's `flightdeck-daemon start` is idempotent (flock-protected) and is a no-op when the daemon is already alive.
6. Resume from § 2.

---

## Returns

To flightdeck's dashboard loop (`workflows/start.md` § 1), after `terminate.md` writes the summary and emits the user-visible line.
