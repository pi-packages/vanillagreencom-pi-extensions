# vstack

Cross-harness package manager for AI coding systems.

Write a package once as a harness-agnostic skill, agent, or hook, then install it into Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Codex, or Pi through one Rust CLI.

## What Is vstack?

`vstack` is two things:

1. A Rust CLI and TUI for discovering, selecting, installing, updating, and removing AI coding packages.
2. A maintained package catalog in this repo containing reusable agents, skills, and hooks.

- Packages are authored once in canonical, harness-agnostic formats.
- `vstack` translates them into each harness's native representation at install time.
- Repos can be swapped. The built-in catalog is just the default source, not the only one.

## Features

- **Cross-harness install**: Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Codex, and Pi from one CLI.
- **Package source management**: switch between repos, add/remove sources from the TUI.
- **Global and project scope**: install once per user, or per project.
- **Dependency resolution**: skills declare required/optional dependencies in `SKILL.md`; required deps are auto-included transitively.
- **Config-driven attribution**: `vstack.toml` maps extra skills to agents, role-wide skills to agent roles, and hook events to roles.
- **Project customization**: per-agent guidance, instructions, custom skills, per-skill instructions, and custom hooks via project-level `vstack.toml` — survives upstream updates.
- **Reconciliation**: installed agents and skills regenerate when packages change, preserving user edits.
- **`vstack refresh`**: reinstall all locked items (agents, skills, hooks, Pi packages) from current source. Defaults to all scopes; narrow with `--scope project|global|all` (or shorthand `-g`).
- **Version-based update check**: notifies when the CLI version changes, not on every repo push. `vstack update --force` to rebuild from source.
- **Source registry**: previously used package repos are remembered and reusable from the TUI.
- **Fast terminal UX**: native Rust TUI with mouse support, built with `ratatui` and `crossterm`.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install the CLI
cargo install --git https://github.com/vanillagreencom/vstack.git vstack

# Open the interactive installer with the default package catalog
vstack add vanillagreencom/vstack
```

### Non-interactive installs

Four item filters narrow `vstack add` — `--agent`, `--skill`, `--hook`, `--pi-extension`. Passing any filter restricts the install to only the kinds you name; kinds without an explicit filter install nothing. To install across multiple kinds, list each. To install everything, pass `--all`.

```bash
vstack add vanillagreencom/vstack --pi-extension pi-web-tools --harness pi -y   # one Pi package
vstack add vanillagreencom/vstack --global --skill decider -y                    # one skill, global
vstack add vanillagreencom/vstack --global --all -y                              # everything, global
```

Every run prints a summary with scope (`PROJECT (...)` vs `GLOBAL (...)`), method, and each item's destination path — read it before claiming success. `--global` without an item filter or `--all` is refused, since it would otherwise install the entire catalog into `~/.config/vstack`, `~/.claude`, `~/.pi`.

### Commands

| Command | Default scope | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `vstack add <source>` | project | Install items (TUI by default; non-interactive with `-y` or filters) |
| `vstack remove <names>` | project | Uninstall items |
| `vstack list` (alias `ls`) | all | Show installed items grouped by scope |
| `vstack check` | all | Validate install state (outdated, orphaned, missing) |
| `vstack refresh` | all | Reinstall locked items from current source. `--verbose`/`-v` prints per-item hash old→new with changed/unchanged status |
| `vstack verify` | all | Confirm the live install matches its source on disk: lock hash vs current source, plus byte-level source-vs-install comparison for Pi packages. Exits non-zero on drift |
| `vstack update-pi` | all | Update Pi packages by version (npm sources or vstack repos) |
| `vstack update` | n/a | Self-update the CLI binary |
| `vstack init <name> --kind <agent\|skill\|hook>` | n/a | Scaffold a new template in a vstack source repo |

All scope-aware commands accept `--scope project|global|all`. `-g`/`--global` is the shorthand for `--scope global` and stays supported. When both are passed, `--scope` wins.

## Project-Local Config

Two config files live at the project root:

- **`vstack.toml`** — agent customization (guidance, instructions, custom skills, custom hooks). Auto-created on first install. Edit and run `vstack refresh` to apply. See [Project Customization](#project-customization).
- **`.env.local`** — workflow config for skills that need it (worktree behavior, issue-tracker tokens, bot auth). Copy [.env.local.example](./.env.local.example) and fill only the variables your project uses. The `worktree` skill symlinks this into created worktrees.

## How It Works

### Mental Model

`vstack` treats a source repo as a package registry:

- `agents/*.md`: canonical agent definitions
- `skills/*/SKILL.md`: canonical skills, rules, scripts, workflows
- `hooks/*.sh`: canonical safety hooks
- `pi-extensions/*/package.json`: optional npm-shaped Pi extension packages
- `vstack.toml`: mapping and attribution rules

### Dependencies And Mapping

Package dependencies are currently skill-to-skill dependencies. A skill can declare them in `SKILL.md` frontmatter:

```yaml
dependencies:
  required: [linear, orchestration, decider]
  optional: []
```

`vstack` builds a dependency graph from installed skills and auto-adds only `required` dependencies. `optional` dependencies are preserved as metadata/documentation, but are not auto-installed.

`vstack.toml` in the source repo is the mapping layer. `[agent-skills]` is the single source of truth for which skills appear in each agent's frontmatter — when an agent has an explicit entry, prefix matching is skipped. `[role-skills]` adds skills to all agents of a role. `[hook-events]` assigns hooks by event/matcher to roles.

```toml
[agent-skills]
rust = ["rust-arch", "rust-async", "rust-cargo", "rust-conventions", "rust-cross", "rust-debugging", "rust-ffi", "rust-no-std", "rust-safety"]
iced = ["iced-rs", "iced-shadcn", "trading-design", "price-handling"]

[role-skills]
engineer = ["issue-lifecycle", "github", "worktree", "decider", "linear"]
reviewer = ["issue-lifecycle", "linear"]

[hook-events]
"PreToolUse:Bash" = "all"
"PostToolUse:Edit|Write" = ["engineer"]
```

### Project Customization

`vstack add` auto-creates a `vstack.toml` at your project root with commented placeholders for every installed agent and skill. Edit the values, then run `vstack refresh` to apply. All sections survive upstream updates — they're re-applied from the config on every install and refresh.

```toml
# What the agent should do when first invoked
[agent-launch-instructions]
rust = "Read open issues and begin working on the highest-priority backend task."
generalist = ""    # empty = no section generated

# Project-specific rules appended to the bottom of agent files
[agent-additional-instructions]
rust = "Always run clippy before committing."

# Skills attached to each agent's frontmatter — single source of truth.
# Populated automatically at install time. Add your own skills to any
# agent's list; remove skills you don't want. Run `vstack refresh` to apply.
[agent-skills]
rust = ["rust-arch", "rust-async", "rust-cargo", "rust-conventions", "rust-cross", "rust-debugging", "rust-ffi", "rust-no-std", "rust-safety", "decider", "github", "issue-lifecycle", "linear", "worktree"]
iced = ["iced-rs", "iced-shadcn", "trading-design", "price-handling", "decider", "github", "issue-lifecycle", "linear", "worktree"]

# Project instructions appended at the bottom of each skill's SKILL.md (won't overwrite the skill author's own)
[skill-instructions]
trading-design = "Focus on dark theme with green/red accent colors."

# Project-local hooks (Claude Code runs the command; other harnesses get the description as inline instructions)
[[custom-hooks]]
event = "PreToolUse"
matcher = "Bash"
command = "./scripts/no-force-push.sh"
description = "Never run git push --force on main or master."
agents = "all"     # "all", a role ("engineer"), or a list ["rust", "iced"]
```

If you edit a generated agent or skill file directly (e.g., add an "Additional Instructions" section), vstack extracts your edits and saves them to `vstack.toml` before the next regeneration — so both approaches work.

### Architecture

```text
source repo
├─ agents/*.md
├─ skills/*/SKILL.md
├─ hooks/*.sh
└─ vstack.toml
        │
        ▼
   vstack CLI / TUI
   - discovers packages
   - resolves dependencies
   - selects repo / scope / harnesses / method
   - applies mapping rules
        │
        ├─ Claude Code → .claude/agents, .claude/skills, .claude/hooks, settings.json
        ├─ Cursor      → .cursor/rules
        ├─ OpenCode    → .opencode/agents, .opencode/skills, opencode.json
        ├─ Codex       → .codex/agents, .agents/skills
        └─ Pi          → .pi/agents, .agents/skills, .pi/packages, .pi/settings.json
```

### Repo Sources

The default source is this repo: `vanillagreencom/vstack`.

The TUI also supports:

- switching between remembered package repos
- adding a new package repo by GitHub shorthand or URL
- persisting known sources in a small registry under vstack's global state

Compatible repos follow the same content model:

```text
agents/
skills/
hooks/
pi-extensions/
vstack.toml
```

`pi-extensions/` is optional — only include it if your repo ships Pi extension packages.

## Supported Harnesses

| Harness | Agents | Skills | Hooks | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `.claude/agents/*.md` | `.claude/skills/<name>/` | native `.claude/hooks/*.sh` + `settings.json` | richest native hook support |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` | `.cursor/rules/<name>/` | safety rules only | project scope only |
| OpenCode | `.opencode/agents/*.md` | `.opencode/skills/<name>/` | instructions + `opencode.json` permissions | config-dir aware |
| Codex | `.codex/agents/*.toml` | `.agents/skills/<name>/` | safety prose in `developer_instructions` | uses `CODEX_HOME` when set |
| Pi | `.pi/agents/*.md` | `.agents/skills/<name>/` | safety prose in agent body | extensions install to `.pi/packages/<name>` and register in `.pi/settings.json` |

Global install behavior:

- Claude Code: user home `~/.claude`
- OpenCode: config-dir based, respecting `OPENCODE_CONFIG` / `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR`
- Codex: `CODEX_HOME` or `~/.codex`
- Pi: `~/.pi/agent`, respecting `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`
- Cursor: intentionally project-only

### Pi notes

- **Agents.** Pi has no built-in subagent mechanism, so `.pi/agents/*.md` files are inert until a loader extension is installed. `pi-agents-tmux` provides that loader; `pi-session-bridge` is a separate TUI side-channel for external controllers.
- **Hooks.** No native Pi hook runtime, so safety hook prose is appended to the agent body instead of running as commands.
- **Extensions.** `vstack add` copies the package into `<scope>/packages/<name>`, registers `./packages/<name>` in that scope's `settings.json` (preserving unrelated entries), and symlinks each `package.json` `bin` entry to `<scope>/bin/<cli-name>`. Add `<scope>/bin` to `PATH` for bare-name invocation. `vstack remove` cleans all three.
- **Extension scope is exclusive.** Pi loads global + project scopes simultaneously, so duplicate registration would crash startup. Installing into one scope when the other already has it is skipped with a notice — `vstack remove [--global]` first to switch.

Windows note:

- The CLI should run natively.
- “Symlink” mode falls back to copy on non-Unix targets.

Source layout:

```text
pi-extensions/
└─ <name>/
   ├─ package.json        npm-shaped, with `pi.extensions` and optional `bin`
   ├─ extensions/*.ts     loaded by Pi via the `pi.extensions` manifest
   ├─ bin/*               optional CLI scripts
   ├─ README.md
   └─ THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md  optional attribution for vendored/base code
```

#### Settings layout

vstack writes Pi's `packages` array using the relative form Pi resolves against the settings file directory:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    "./packages/pi-session-bridge",
    "./packages/pi-qol"
  ]
}
```

| Scope | Settings file | Packages directory |
|---|---|---|
| Global | `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` | `~/.pi/agent/packages/<name>/` |
| Project | `.pi/settings.json` | `.pi/packages/<name>/` |

Other `settings.json` keys are preserved; legacy absolute-path entries auto-rewrite to the relative form on the next `vstack add`/`refresh`. `pi-extension-manager` stores disabled lists and extension setting values under `vstack.extensionManager`, separate from Pi's top-level `extensions` resource-path setting.
