## What Is vstack?

- Rust CLI/TUI for discovering, installing, updating, and removing AI coding packages.
- Maintained catalog in this repo (agents, skills, hooks, Pi extensions).
- Packages authored harness-agnostic; vstack translates per harness at install.
- Source repo is swappable — this catalog is the default, not the only one.

## Features

- **Cross-harness install** — Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Codex, Pi from one CLI.
- **Global or project scope** — install per user or per project.
- **Skill dependencies** — required deps install transitively; optional deps stay documentation-only.
- **Config-driven attribution** — `vstack.toml` maps skills/hooks to agents and roles.
- **Project customization** — per-agent guidance, colors, custom skills, per-skill instructions, custom hooks. Survives upstream updates.
- **Reconciliation** — agents/skills regenerate on changes, preserving user edits.
- **Lockfile refresh** — `vstack refresh` reinstalls all locked items; `--scope project|global|all` narrows.
- **Source switching** — multiple package repos persisted in a global registry, swappable from the TUI.
- **Fast TUI** — native Rust + mouse, built on `ratatui`/`crossterm`.

## Quick Start

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/vanillagreencom/vstack.git vstack
vstack add vanillagreencom/vstack   # interactive installer
```

### Commands

| Command | Default scope | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `vstack add <source>` | project | Install items (TUI by default; non-interactive with `-y` and item filters) |
| `vstack remove <names>` | project | Uninstall items |
| `vstack list` (alias `ls`) | all | Show installed items grouped by scope |
| `vstack check` | all | Validate install state (outdated, orphaned, missing) |
| `vstack refresh` | all | Reinstall locked items from current source. `--verbose`/`-v` prints per-item hash old→new with changed/unchanged status |
| `vstack verify` | all | Confirm the live install matches its source on disk: lock hash vs current source, plus byte-level source-vs-install comparison for Pi packages. Exits non-zero on drift |
| `vstack update-pi` | all | Update Pi packages by version (npm sources or vstack repos) |
| `vstack update` | n/a | Self-update the CLI binary |
| `vstack init <name> --kind <agent\|skill\|hook>` | n/a | Scaffold a new template in a vstack source repo |

All scope-aware commands accept `--scope project|global|all`. `-g`/`--global` is shorthand for `--scope global`. When both are passed, `--scope` wins.

Non-interactive `add` examples (item filters `--agent`, `--skill`, `--hook`, `--pi-extension` restrict the install; `--all` includes everything; `-y` skips the TUI):

```bash
vstack add vanillagreencom/vstack --pi-extension pi-web-tools --harness pi -y
vstack add vanillagreencom/vstack --global --skill decider -y
vstack add vanillagreencom/vstack --global --all -y
```

## Project-Local Config

Two files at the project root:

- **`vstack.toml`** — agent customization. Auto-created by `vstack add`. Edit, then `vstack refresh`. See [Project Customization](#project-customization).
- **`.env.local`** — skill config (tokens, paths, auth). Copy from [.env.local.example](./.env.local.example). Symlinked into worktrees by the `worktree` skill.

## How It Works

### Mental Model

A source repo is a package registry:

- `agents/*.md` — agent definitions
- `skills/*/SKILL.md` — skill packages (rules, scripts, workflows alongside)
- `hooks/*.sh` — safety hooks
- `pi-extensions/*/package.json` — npm-shaped Pi extension packages
- `vstack.toml` — mapping and attribution rules

### Dependencies And Mapping

**Skill dependencies.** A skill lists the other skills it needs in its `SKILL.md` frontmatter:

```yaml
dependencies:
  required: [linear, orchestration, decider]
  optional: []
```

`required` deps install transitively whenever the skill installs. `optional` deps are documentation only — they're not auto-installed.

**Agent attribution.** The source repo's `vstack.toml` decides which skills and hooks attach to which agents:

- `[agent-skills]` — explicit skills per agent.
- `[role-skills]` — skills added to every agent of a role (`engineer`, `reviewer`, `manager`).
- `[hook-events]` — hooks attached by event/matcher, scoped to roles or `"all"`.

```toml
[agent-skills]
rust = ["rust-arch", "rust-async", "rust-cargo"]
iced = ["iced-rs", "iced-shadcn"]

[role-skills]
engineer = ["issue-lifecycle", "github", "worktree", "decider", "linear"]
reviewer = ["issue-lifecycle", "linear"]

[hook-events]
"PreToolUse:Bash" = "all"
"PostToolUse:Edit|Write" = ["engineer"]
```

### Project Customization

`vstack add` auto-creates `vstack.toml` with placeholders for each installed agent and skill. Edit, then `vstack refresh`. All sections survive upstream updates — re-applied on every install/refresh.

```toml
# Launch instruction per agent.
[agent-launch-instructions]
rust = "Read open issues, pick up the highest-priority backend task."
generalist = ""    # empty = no section

# Extra rules appended to the agent file.
[agent-additional-instructions]
rust = "Always run clippy before committing."

# Skills per agent. Auto-populated; edit freely.
[agent-skills]
rust = ["rust-arch", "rust-cargo", "decider", "github", "worktree"]
iced = ["iced-rs", "trading-design", "decider", "github", "worktree"]

# Agent display color written to supported agent frontmatter.
# Pi subagent panes use this for the statusline badge background.
[agent-colors]
rust = "green"
iced = "magenta"

# Project instructions appended to a skill's SKILL.md.
[skill-instructions]
trading-design = "Dark theme, green/red accents."

# Custom hooks. Claude Code runs the command; others use description as inline rules.
[[custom-hooks]]
event = "PreToolUse"
matcher = "Bash"
command = "./scripts/no-force-push.sh"
description = "Never `git push --force` on main or master."
agents = "all"     # "all" | role | [agent names]
```

Direct edits to generated agent/skill files are extracted into `vstack.toml` before the next regeneration — both approaches work.

### Architecture

```text

├─ agents/*.md
├─ skills/*/SKILL.md
├─ hooks/*.sh
└─ vstack.toml
        │
        ▼
   vstack CLI / TUI
   - discovers packages
   - resolves dependencies
   - selects repo / scope / harnesses / method
   - applies mapping rules
        │
        ├─ Claude Code → .claude/agents, .claude/skills, .claude/hooks, settings.json
        ├─ Cursor      → .cursor/rules

```

### Repo Sources

Default: `vanillagreencom/vstack`. The TUI switches between remembered repos or adds new ones (GitHub shorthand or URL).

Compatible repos:

```text

pi-extensions/   # optional
vstack.toml
```

## Supported Harnesses

| Harness | Agents | Skills | Hooks | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `.claude/agents/*.md` | `.claude/skills/<name>/` | native `.claude/hooks/*.sh` + `settings.json` | richest native hook support |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` | `.cursor/rules/<name>/` | safety rules only | project scope only |
| OpenCode | `.opencode/agents/*.md` | `.opencode/skills/<name>/` | instructions + `opencode.json` permissions | config-dir aware |
| Codex | `.codex/agents/*.toml` | `.agents/skills/<name>/` | safety prose in `developer_instructions` | uses `CODEX_HOME` when set |
| Pi | `.pi/agents/*.md` | `.agents/skills/<name>/` | safety prose in agent body | extensions install to `.pi/packages/<name>` and register in `.pi/settings.json` |

Global install behavior:

- Claude Code: user home `~/.claude`
- OpenCode: config-dir based, respecting `OPENCODE_CONFIG` / `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR`
- Codex: `CODEX_HOME` or `~/.codex`
- Pi: `~/.pi/agent`, respecting `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`
- Cursor: intentionally project-only

### Pi notes

- **Agents.** `.pi/agents/*.md` are inert without a loader extension (`pi-agents-tmux`). `pi-session-bridge` is a separate TUI side-channel for external controllers.
- **Hooks.** No native runtime; safety prose is appended to the agent body.
- **Extensions.** `vstack add` copies to `<scope>/packages/<name>`, registers in `settings.json`, symlinks each `bin` entry to `<scope>/bin/<cli>`. Add `<scope>/bin` to `PATH`. `vstack remove` cleans all three.
- **Scope is exclusive.** Pi loads global + project together — duplicate registration crashes startup. vstack skips duplicates with a notice; use `vstack remove [-g]` to switch.

Windows: CLI runs natively; symlink mode falls back to copy on non-Unix targets.

Source layout:

```text
pi-extensions/
└─ <name>/
   ├─ package.json        npm-shaped, with `pi.extensions` and optional `bin`
   ├─ extensions/*.ts     loaded by Pi via the `pi.extensions` manifest
   ├─ bin/*               optional CLI scripts
   ├─ README.md
   └─ THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md  optional attribution for vendored/base code
```

#### Settings layout

vstack writes Pi's `packages` as relative paths (resolved against the settings file dir):

```json
{
  "packages": [
    "./packages/pi-session-bridge",
    "./packages/pi-qol"
  ]
}
```

| Scope | Settings file | Packages directory |
|---|---|---|
| Global | `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` | `~/.pi/agent/packages/<name>/` |
| Project | `.pi/settings.json` | `.pi/packages/<name>/` |

Other keys are preserved. Legacy absolute paths auto-rewrite on next `add`/`refresh`. `pi-extension-manager` writes its disabled list + setting values under `vstack.extensionManager`.
