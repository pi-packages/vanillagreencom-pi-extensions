# pi-tool-renderer

Compact renderers for built-in Pi tools.

By default this package renders non-mutating tool calls (`read`, `bash`, and, when available, `grep`/`find`/`ls`) as tight Claude-style stacked rows instead of padded boxes. It re-registers built-in tools with the same names and delegates execution to the original Pi implementations. Stack rows are width-truncated instead of wrapped to keep the ASCII tree compact. It changes only `renderCall`/`renderResult` so `Ctrl+O` remains Pi's expand/collapse mechanism.

It does **not** override Pi's built-in `edit`/`write` renderers by default, so standard diff/edit rendering is preserved. Disable `stackToolCalls` to keep the compact renderers inside Pi's normal tool boxes, or disable `enabled` to return fully to Pi defaults.

Current Pi still reserves vertical space for each tool entry even when a renderer returns zero lines. `stackChildDisplay` controls the tradeoff:

- `rows` (default): child tools render as separate compact `├`/`└` rows.
- `headline`: child rows are hidden and the anchor headline shows the list only when expanded.
- `anchor-list`: child rows are hidden and the anchor headline shows the compact `├`/`└` list by default.

`hideStackChildRows=true` is kept as a legacy alias for `stackChildDisplay="headline"` when `stackChildDisplay` is unset.

Known limitation: Pi currently reserves spacer rows for hidden tool entries, and hidden `Thinking...` labels cannot be fully removed from an extension; fixing those requires Pi core renderer changes.

Set `renderMutationTools=true` to opt into compact `edit`/`write` renderers. When enabled, expanded edit diffs are rendered in full and are not line-truncated by this extension.
