![/caveman command autocomplete](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanillagreencom/vstack/main/pi-extensions/pi-caveman/assets/command-autocomplete.png)

Native Pi caveman communication mode: fewer output tokens, same technical accuracy.

## Install

Via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vanillagreen/pi-caveman):

```bash
pi install npm:@vanillagreen/pi-caveman
```

Via [vstack](https://github.com/vanillagreencom/vstack):

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/vanillagreencom/vstack.git vstack
vstack add vanillagreencom/vstack --pi-extension pi-caveman --harness pi -y
```

Restart Pi after installation.

## Commands

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `/caveman` | Toggle the current session between off and the last active mode. |
| `/caveman:lite\|full\|ultra\|micro` | Set a session override mode. |
| `/caveman:toggle` | Toggle the session override between off and the last active mode. |
| `/caveman off` | Disable caveman mode for the current session. |
| `/caveman status` | Show current mode and whether it comes from settings or a session override. |
| `/caveman debug` | Show resolved mode, settings paths, legacy-key conflicts, and the rendered prompt block. |

Arguments support autocomplete.

## Modes

| Mode | Style |
| --- | --- |
| `lite` | Professional full sentences, but no filler or hedging. |
| `full` | Classic terse caveman; fragments are OK. |
| `ultra` | Maximum English compression with abbreviations and arrows. |
| `micro` | Shortest prompt injection for token-sensitive sessions. |

## Behavior

- The extension injects instructions in `before_agent_start`; it does not post-process model output.
- The canonical setting is `mode` (`off`, `lite`, `full`, `ultra`, or `micro`). Older `enabled` + `defaultMode` settings are only read as a local fallback.
- `/caveman` commands create a per-session override when `sessionOverrideAllowed` is on. Changing the extension-manager `mode` setting clears the session override so the configured mode takes over immediately.
- Session override state and the last active mode persist in the Pi session and restore from the active branch.
- Settings live in Pi/vstack `settings.json`; project settings override user settings.
- QOL can use the caveman bridge for its compact statusline badge and `Alt+C` editor shortcut.
- The hard clarity-safety escape only fires when the user prompt names an explicit irreversible destructive operation (force-push, drop table, rm -rf, hard reset, destructive/irreversible). The model still self-elects plain prose for genuine destructive confirmations via an inline auto-clarity rule, but no longer escapes on soft signals like "confused" or "security".
- Boundary toggles keep caveman out of text destined for other systems: code/identifiers, commit messages and PR descriptions, formal reviews, and external writes (Linear/GitHub issues + comments, PR/code-review comments, chat). Caveman is for in-chat replies.
