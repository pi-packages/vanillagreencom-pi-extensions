# pi-codex-minimal-tools

![apply_patch side-by-side diff rendering](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanillagreencom/vstack/main/pi-extensions/pi-codex-minimal-tools/assets/apply-patch-rendering.png)

Minimal Codex/OpenAI tool augmentation for Pi. This package adds the useful Codex-style tools without replacing Pi native tools like `read`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`, `bash`, `edit`, or `write`.

Implemented features:

- `view_image` — validate and return a local image file as model image content.
- `apply_patch` — local Codex-style patch application with the public argument shape `{ input: string }`.
- `image_generation` — native OpenAI Codex image generation on supported models.
- `/codex-minimal-tools` — opens the extension-manager settings popup when `pi-extension-manager` is installed; otherwise prints status and active package tools inline.
- Capability gating that only adds/removes this package's tools and preserves Pi native tools.
- OpenAI-loaded gating: package tools are not registered until OpenAI/OpenAI-Codex models are present.
- Native-aware OpenAI Codex provider shim for active `image_generation` tools.
- Generated image saving under `imageOutputDir` with `latest.<ext>` mirrors.
- Optional direct OpenAI Images API fallback when `directImageApiFallback` is enabled and `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set.

`web_search` moved to the `pi-web-tools` package. Old `pi-codex-minimal-tools` web-search settings are ignored after this migration.

## Install

Via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vanillagreen/pi-codex-minimal-tools):

```bash
pi install npm:@vanillagreen/pi-codex-minimal-tools
```

Via [vstack](https://github.com/vanillagreencom/vstack):

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/vanillagreencom/vstack.git vstack
vstack add vanillagreencom/vstack --pi-extension pi-codex-minimal-tools --harness pi -y
```

Restart Pi after installation.

## Commands

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `/codex-minimal-tools` | Open the extension-manager settings popup (falls back to inline status when the manager is not installed). |
| `/codex-minimal-tools:doctor` | Run lightweight self-checks. |

Arguments support autocomplete.

## Settings

When `pi-extension-manager` is installed, settings appear under **Codex Minimal Tools** in `/extensions` and `/extensions:settings`. Values are read from:

```json
{
  "vstack": {
    "extensionManager": {
      "config": {
        "pi-codex-minimal-tools": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Project `.pi/settings.json` overrides user `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`.

Important defaults:

- `autoEnable`: `true`
- `nativeProviderTools`: `true`
- `applyPatchEnabled`: `true`
- `deferApplyPatchRendering`: `true`
- `strictPatchMode`: `false`

## Reloading

If this package is already loaded in a running Pi session, use `/reload` after installing/updating it so Pi loads the new extension code and command/tool registrations. Starting a new Pi process also works.

## apply_patch rendering

`apply_patch` is registered with:

- tool name exactly `apply_patch`
- primary argument key `input`
- no `renderCall` / `renderResult` by default

This lets `pi-tool-renderer` attach its existing `applyPatchRenderer` hook. Without that package, Pi's fallback renderer still shows the raw success/error text.

## Development

```bash
cd pi-extensions/pi-codex-minimal-tools
npm install
npm run check
```
