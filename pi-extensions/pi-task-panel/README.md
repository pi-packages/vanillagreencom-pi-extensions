# pi-task-panel

Persistent structured task panel above the Pi status line/editor.

Commands include `/todo add`, `/todo start`, `/todo done`, `/todo drop`, `/todo rm`, `/todo clear-completed`, `/todo hide`, `/todo show`, `/todo show-all`, `/todo compact`, `/todo expand`, `/todo edit`, `/todo export`, `/todo import`, and `/todo manage`.

The model can update tasks with the `todo_write` tool. Tool results render as compact inline status rows like `● Task "name" completed` by default; set `compactToolOutput=false` to use Pi's normal padded tool box. The panel keeps one active task highlighted, automatically advances to the next pending task when the active task is completed/dropped, hides when all tasks are complete, and reappears when pending work is added.

State follows Pi's todo example pattern by storing task snapshots in `todo_write` result details, with project/session custom entries as an extra restore path. When tasks remain, `showWorkflowReminder` adds a short model-facing reminder to use `start_task`, `mark_done`/`drop_task`, and `add_task` at the right times.

Keyboard conflict: Pi uses `Ctrl+T` for thinking visibility. This package always registers the alternate shortcut from settings (`Alt+T` by default). The shortcut cycles `hidden → show 4 → show all`. It registers `Ctrl+T` only when `takeoverCtrlT` is enabled in the extension manager and Pi is reloaded.
