Persistent task panel above the Pi status line. Tasks are managed by the agent through the `tasks_write` tool or by you through `/tasks`.

## Highlights

- Compact panel above the editor shows active and pending tasks at a glance.
- Expanded mode groups by phase and shows notes for the active task.
- Auto-advance moves to the next pending task when the active one is completed or dropped.
- Auto-hide when all tasks are done; reappears when pending work is added.
- Bulk-edit, import, and export tasks as plain markdown.
- Workflow reminders nudge the agent to keep the panel in sync.
- Per-session sidecar state keeps slash-command edits and pending tasks resumable before the next model turn writes tool-result history.

## Manager keys

`↑/↓` selects. `Enter`/`s` starts, `d` marks done, `x` drops, `r` removes, `c` clears completed, `e` opens bulk edit.

Bulk edit format:

```
- Phase A :: First task (active)
- Phase A :: Second task (done)
- Phase B :: Third task
```

Status suffixes: `(active)`, `(done)`, `(dropped)`.

## Shortcut

Pi uses `Ctrl+T` for thinking visibility. The default panel shortcut is `Alt+T`, which cycles `hidden → show 4 → show all`. Enable **Use Ctrl+T for tasks** in settings to take over `Ctrl+T`.

The manager popup opens with `Alt+Shift+T` (or `F4`).

## Settings

All settings live in the extension manager under **Task Panel**.

### Panel

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Default panel state | `hidden`, `compact`, or `expanded` when tasks first appear. |
| Compact task count | Max tasks shown in compact mode. |
| Show active notes | Show notes for the active task in expanded mode. |
| Auto-show on first task | Reveal the panel automatically when the first task is added. |

### Keyboard

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Use Ctrl+T for tasks | Take over `Ctrl+T` (overrides Pi's thinking-visibility binding). |
| Alternate shortcut | Always-available shortcut. Default `alt+t`. |
| Manager popup shortcut | Default `alt+shift+t`. |

### Tool output

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Compact tasks_write output | Render `tasks_write` results as a single inline status row. |

### Reminders

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Task workflow reminders | Inject hidden task context so the agent reconciles state before replying. |
| Incomplete-task reminders | Subtle reminder when a turn ends with incomplete tasks. |
