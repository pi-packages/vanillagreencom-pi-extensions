# pi-skills-manager

Dedicated Pi skills manager for vstack packages.

`pi-skills-manager` replaces a crowded slash menu full of `/skill:*` entries with one polished `/skills` workflow for browsing, previewing, inserting, creating, editing, renaming, deleting, and enabling/disabling skills.

## Commands

- `/skills` — open the skills manager overlay.
- `/skills disable` — disable the manager feature toggle; run `/reload` to unload hooks/commands.
- `/skills enable` — recovery command when disabled; enables the manager and reloads.

## What it does

- Hides native `/skill:<name>` commands by writing `enableSkillCommands: false` to the matching Pi settings scope.
- Hides Pi's default startup `[Skills]` block so skill discovery lives in the dedicated manager.
- Shows project/global skills separately from package/library skills.
- Searches by name, description, source, scope, and path.
- Inserts selected enabled skills into the editor as `[skill] <name>` markers; the marker expands into full `<skill>` content before the prompt is sent.
- Previews full metadata/frontmatter and rendered skill content.
- Toggles skills on/off through Pi settings filters. Run `/reload` after toggles to fully apply prompt/resource changes.
- Creates new project/global skills with the current model and thinking level, falling back to a deterministic template if model auth is unavailable.
- Edits, renames, and deletes your own top-level project/global skills. Package skills are preview/toggle/insert only.

## Keys

Browse mode:

- Type to search.
- `↑/↓` select.
- `Enter` inserts an enabled skill, or starts **Create new skill** from the first row.
- `Tab` previews the selected skill.
- `Ctrl+X` enables/disables the selected skill.
- `Backspace` deletes your own selected skill when the search box is empty.
- `Esc` clears search, then closes.

Preview mode:

- `↑/↓`, `PageUp/PageDown`, `Home/End` scroll.
- `Enter` inserts an enabled skill.
- `Ctrl+X` enables/disables.
- `e` edits your own skills.
- `r` renames your own skills.
- `Backspace` or `d` deletes your own skills.
- `Esc` or `Tab` returns to browse.

Edit mode:

- `Ctrl+S` saves.
- `Esc` returns to preview.

Create flow:

1. Name — normalized to a lowercase skill slug.
2. Description — trigger-focused skill description.
3. Visibility — project (`.pi/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) or global (`~/.pi/agent/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`).

## Settings

Settings are exposed through `pi-extension-manager` under **Skills Manager**:

- `enabled`: feature toggle for the manager.
- `hideNativeSkillCommands`: writes `enableSkillCommands=false` to keep slash commands clean.
- `hideStartupSkillsBlock`: hides Pi's startup skill list.
- `cleanupIncompleteMarkers`: removes partial `[skill]` marker fragments when possible.
- `aiGenerationEnabled`: use the current model to draft new `SKILL.md` files.
- `defaultCreateLocation`: project or global.
- `popupWidth`, `popupMaxHeight`, `listRows`: overlay layout.

## Notes

This package intentionally mutates Pi's top-level `enableSkillCommands` setting when `hideNativeSkillCommands` is enabled. Other vstack-specific settings live under `vstack.extensionManager.config.pi-skills-manager`.
