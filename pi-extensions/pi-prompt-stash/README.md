Popup controls:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Search stashed prompts. |
| `↑` / `↓` | Move selection. |

## Storage

Stashes are stored per Pi session under `~/.pi/agent/vstack/prompt-stash/sessions/<session-id>/prompt-stash.json`, even when the package is enabled by project settings. Legacy manager config under `prompt-stash` is still read, and legacy `.pi/prompt-stash.json` files are imported into the current session and removed on load/use.
